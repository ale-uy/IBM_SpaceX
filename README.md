### üéØ Objective
To analyze historical SpaceX launch data and build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a Falcon 9 first-stage booster will land successfully.

### üõ†Ô∏è Process
This project follows the data science lifecycle from collection to modeling:
- **Data Collection:** Web scraped launch data from Wikipedia using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
- **Data Analysis:** Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn`.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Trained and evaluated several classification models using `Scikit-learn`.

### üíª Technologies Used
`Python` | `Pandas` | `NumPy` | `Scikit-learn` | `BeautifulSoup` | `Matplotlib` | `Seaborn`
